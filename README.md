Database Created With Oracle SQL Developer and Oracle Data Modeler
This project was my first exposure to SQL and data bases in general. We were to choose a field where a database could potential be used or if a data base existed already we would have to upgrade it. Test data was part of the requirements for the project as well as the insertion of the data. Documentation was needed including detailed descritpions of every table along with sample SQL queries with their respective output.
